# Azure Stack HCI

I built my own Azure Stack HCI 23H2 home lab.  Read all about it [on my blog](https://www.nathannellans.com/post/my-azure-stack-hci-home-lab-part-1)

In this repo you will find the following items:
- `AKS`: a Bicep template to help you deploy Azure Kubernete Service on Stack HCI.  This includes a Logical Network as well.
- `AVD` (Coming Soon): a Bicep template to help you deploy Azure Virtual Desktop on Stack HCI.
